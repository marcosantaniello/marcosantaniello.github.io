# Simple GitHub Page for Researchers

This repository contains source code for a simple [website](https://marcosantaniello.github.io/) with dynamic links, contact and social media info, an about section, as well as lists for publications and projects. 
I thank [Lennard Welslau](https://lennardwelslau.github.io/) for publicly sharing his website template which I used.
